This project contains the 7 excersices for the Big Data Systems Course of the ECI2007 in UBA

Some of the excersices were implemented in Linux, others in Windows

Most of the implementations were done in Java (because of personal expertise in that programming language)

Those are just simple applications, that were performed in order to learn the basics of these big data tools.

Each folder of this project represents a Big Data tool. Description of the applications and the problem they solve
can be found on a README file per each tool.
