Topic: Hadoop
Architecture: Single Node Cluster
Programming Language: JAVA
Problem: Count the muliples of a given number
Input: A file generated with a HDFS application. The file contains a list of numbers
Output: The result of counting the multiples

Example:

Given a list of the numbers 2,5,8,10,13,15,16
and the target number 2
Then the application should return that the count of multiples of 2 are 4.
Because there are 4 multiples of 2 (2, 8, 10, 16)

An example of the list is also provided in the source folder of the code

To run the program, just run "hadoop jar multipleOfCount.jar 2 inputFile outputDir"
where 2 is the target
inputFile is the file with numbers generetaed by the HDFS application
and outputDir the name you choose for storing the results of your output

The folder "BigDataCourse" contains the source of the code
The folder "PersonalHadoopConf" contains the conf files used for the student's vm hadoop settings
The folder "RequiredLibs" contains the required libs that have to be imported at openning the code in an IDE
