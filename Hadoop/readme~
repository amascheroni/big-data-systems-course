Topic: Hadoop
Architecture: Single Node Cluster
Problem: Count the muliples of a given number
Input: A file generated with a HDFS application. The file contains a list of numbers
Output: The result of counting the multiples

Example:

Given a list of the numbers 2,5,8,10,13,15,16
and the target number 2
Then the application should return that the count of multiples of 2 are 4.
Because there are 4 multiples of 2 (2, 8, 10, 16)

An example of the list is also provided in the source folder of the code
