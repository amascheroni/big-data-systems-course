Topic: HDFS
Architecture: Single Node Cluster
Programming Language: Bash
Problem: Create a File in the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS). The file will be the input for the hadoop application and it will be composed by a list of numbers. Additional verifications will be made.

To run the program:
1 - move the generate.sh file into your hadoop/bin folder.
2 - start your hadoop daemons
3 - grant running permissions to the file with the following command: chmod u+x ./generator.sh
4 - run ./generator.sh

note that the generator script will check that the hadoop daemons are already started, and that the file to generated is not already created in the HDFS
