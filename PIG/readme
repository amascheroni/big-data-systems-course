Topic: PIG
Architecture: Single Node Cluster
Programming Language: PIG Latin
Problem: Count the muliples of a given number (this is the same excersice presented for Hadoop, but using Pig)
Input: A file generated with a HDFS application. The file contains a list of numbers
Output: The result of counting the multiples

Example:

Given a list of the numbers 2,5,8,10,13,15,16
and the target number 2
Then the application should return that the count of multiples of 2 are 4.
Because there are 4 multiples of 2 (2, 8, 10, 16)

An example of the list is also provided in the source folder of the code

To run the program, just run "pig -f multipleOf.pig -param target=2"
where 2 is the target

To see the results, type "hadoop fs -cat outputPig/p*"
You should see the following output
	The count of multiples of 2 is: 	156

Pre-requisites:
- Having hadoop, pig, jre and jdk installed
